.SH "NAME"
locale\-gen \- generate locales on the fly
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The locale\-gen utility is used to manage locales on your system.  Often times
it merely generates a user configurable list of locales, but it can be used to
generate a few locales on the fly as needed.

Normally all locales would be generated at build time, but this leads to waste
of disk and time as many users really just want a handful on their system.
