.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The locale\-gen utility provides a means by which a system administrator may conveniently manage the set of locales that are made available to the GNU C Library. It accomplishes this by acting as a user-friendly frontend for the \fBlocaledef\fR(1) utility, which is used to compile locales and integrate them into a central archive.
.P
By default, locale\-gen generates an archive containing a full complement of supported locales, numbering 500 or more. However, it is typical for an administrator to require only one or two of these. In that case, the \fIconfig\fR file may be populated with a list of the required locales. Consequently, locale\-gen shall compile only those, saving both time and space in the longer term.
.P
If the \fIconfig\fR file is missing, empty, or consists only of comments, locale\-gen shall act in one of two ways, depending on whether the \fB\-c\fR option or LOCALEGEN\_CONFIG environment variable was specified. If neither was specified, locale\-gen shall act as if the \fB\-A\fR option had been specified. Otherwise, locale\-gen shall abort.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\fB\-A\fR, \fB\-\-all\fR
Compile all locales that are officially supported by glibc. Cannot be combined with the \fB-c\fR option.
.TP
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-config\fR \fIconfig\fR
Read the given \fIconfig\fR file (defaults to \fIprefix\fR/etc/locale.gen). If specified as a \%<hyphen-minus>, locale\-gen shall read the configuration from standard input.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Write out a synopsis and summary of the supported options then exit.
.TP
\fB\-j\fR, \fB\-\-jobs\fR \fIjobs\fR
Spawn up to the specified number of \fIjobs\fR to compile locales in parallel (defaults to the number of logical processors).
.TP
\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-prefix\fR \fIprefix\fR
Treat FILES as being relative to the specified \fIprefix\fR (defaults to / if not a Gentoo Prefix system). Where explicitly specified, the \fIconfig\fR file shall be exempted from this behaviour.
.TP
\fB\-q\fR, \fB\-\-quiet\fR
Suppress the writing of informational messages to standard output.
.TP
\fB\-u\fR, \fB\-\-update\fR
Suppress the compilation of locales that are already installed (not recommended).
.TP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
Write out some details regarding the program then exit.
.SH "FILES"
.TP
.I /etc/locale.gen
The default location of the \fIconfig\fR file. It specifies the locales to be compiled.
.TP
.I /usr/share/i18n/SUPPORTED
A complete list of valid locale declarations, as provided by glibc.
.TP
.I /usr/lib/locale/locale\-archive
Contains the currently installed locales.
.TP
.I /usr/share/i18n/locales
Contains locale definition files that serve as inputs to \fBlocaledef\fR(1).
.TP
.I /usr/share/i18n/charmaps
Contains character map files that serve as inputs to \fBlocaledef\fR(1).
.SH "ENVIRONMENT"
.TP
LOCALEGEN\_ALLOW\_UNSUPPORTED
If set as a non-empty string, locale\-gen shall convey validation errors as warnings. Validation is performed by comparing the entries of the \fIconfig\fR file against the \fI/usr/share/i18n/SUPPORTED\fR file.
.TP
LOCALEGEN\_CONFIG
Defines the path of the \fIconfig\fR file in the absence of the \fB-A\fR and \fB-c\fR options.
.TP
NO_COLOR
If set as a non-empty string, coloured output text shall be disabled.
.SH "EXIT STATUS"
The exit status shall be 0 under any of these conditions:
.IP \[bu] 2
the \fB\-h\fR and/or \fB\-V\fR options were specified
.IP \[bu] 2
the \fB\-u\fR option was specified but no locales need compiling
.IP \[bu] 2
the options and \fIconfig\fR were validated, the specified locales compiled and the resulting archive installed, without error
.P
Otherwise, the exit status shall be greater than 0.
