.SH "NAME"
locale.gen - configuration file for locale\-gen
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The \fBlocale\-gen\fR(8) utility compiles the locales specified by the
\fI/etc/locale.gen\fR file and integrates them into a locale archive.
.P
If present, the file must be comprised by zero or more lines, each of which
must be comprised by two fields, separated by one or more <blank> characters.
Leading and trailing <blank> characters are permitted. The first field shall be
considered as a \fIlocalename\fR and the second field as a \fIcharmap\fR. The
\fI/usr/share/i18n/SUPPORTED\fR file contains a complete list of the supported
combinations.
.P
Lines that are empty, or which contain only <blank> characters, shall be
disregarded. Also, lines that begin with zero or more <blank> characters,
followed by a <number\-sign> character,  shall be considered as comments and
disregarded.
.P
The definition of a <blank> character is that it is either the <tab> or <space>
character.
.SH "LOCALE NAMES"
The GNU C Library employs a locale naming scheme that is based upon the X/Open
Portability Guide (XPG). A \fIlocalename\fR is composed of between one and four
parts.

.P
A complete list of supported \fIlocalename\fR values can be obtained by reading
the first column of the \fI/usr/share/i18n/SUPPORTED\fR file.
.P
Assuming that a given locale is available, it can be effected by assigning its
\fIlocalename\fR to the LANG environment variable.
.SH "CHARACTER MAPS"
A \fIcharmap\fR, also known as a character set or codeset, is a mapping of
character symbols and collating element symbols to actual character encodings,
allowing for computers to encode and decode text in a standard way.
.P
A complete list of supported \fIcharmap\fR values can be obtained by reading
the second column of the \fI/usr/share/i18n/SUPPORTED\fR file.
.P
Given that not all values of \fIlocalename\fR incorporate a codeset, the
configuration file requires for the second field of each line to define a
\fIcharmap\fR.
